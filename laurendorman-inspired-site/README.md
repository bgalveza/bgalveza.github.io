# Single‑column Portfolio (Original Code, GitHub Pages Ready)

This is an original re‑implementation inspired by text‑first portfolio sites. It mirrors the structure — name + intro, selected work list, writing, recognitions, and contact — without copying any third‑party code or content.

## Quick start
Just open `index.html` in your browser. No build step.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repository and push these files to the repo root.
2. In **Settings → Pages**: Source = *Deploy from a branch*, Branch = *main*, Folder = */ (root)*.
3. GitHub Actions workflow included; it builds nothing (static) and deploys instantly.

## Customize
- Edit text/links in `index.html` (name, intro, work items, writing, recognitions, contact).
- Tweak colors & spacing in `assets/css/style.css`.
- Add icons or OG images if desired.
