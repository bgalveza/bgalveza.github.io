# Minimal Portfolio (GitHub Pages Ready)

This is a simple, fast, static portfolio inspired by type‑first, minimal sites. No build step required.

## Local preview
Just open `index.html` in your browser, or serve the folder with any static server.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g. `username.github.io` for a user site or any name for a project site).
2. Add these files to the repo root and push.
3. Enable Pages:
   - Go to **Settings → Pages**.
   - **Source**: select `Deploy from a branch`.
   - **Branch**: choose `main` (or `master`) and `/ (root)`; save.
4. Your site will be available at:
   - `https://username.github.io/` (user/organization site), or
   - `https://username.github.io/repo-name/` (project site).
5. If you use a custom domain, create a `CNAME` file (already included) with your domain and add a CNAME record in your DNS.

## Customize
- Replace `Your Name`, `you@example.com`, and the placeholder copy.
- Swap the avatar/OG images in `assets/img` with your own.
- Add more projects in `work.html` and cards in `index.html`.
- Tweak colors in `assets/css/style.css` (`:root` variables).

## Notes
- This code is original and not a copy of any third‑party site; it’s only inspired by the minimal layout and sections (hero, selected work, recognitions).
